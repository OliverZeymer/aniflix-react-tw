# Aniflix

Welcome to my first big web project! Aniflix is an anime browsing site that uses the [MAL API](https://jikan.moe/) for data. Browse a massive API of over 23.000 anime series and see trailers, ratings, stats, descriptions and where to stream the series. This project has a lot of nostalgia for me, i first developed it with vanilla html, css and javascript back in February 2022 and have since remade it in React and TailwindCSS. In the future i plan to create a Node.js backend and make it a completed project with user login, favorites and all that good stuff.
